## Our Story

Nick, Dale and Paul are close friends who worked together on small projects in evenings and weekends for several years, slowly building up a business to be proud of and one we could all commit to full time. In 2019 NDP Roofing was formed and now trading as Royal Roofing, our small business venture is gaining a great reputation throughout Cornwall for the service we provide.

With many years of experience in the industry, you are guaranteed to receive a 5 star service from us. We specialise in slate & lead roof coverings but also pride ourselves in the attention to detail we give to all of our projects, no matter how big or small.

We are proud to be part of the ongoing refurbishment and development of Carbis Bay Hotel properties and the new build housing development in the small Cornish village of Barripper.

Please take a look through our gallery and read some of the feedback weâ€™ve received over the years!
