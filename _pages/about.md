## Our Story
Royal Roofing was formed in 2016, in 2019 Dale and Paul joined Nick in business and NDP Roofing was founded. The business was built up from hard work over evenings and weekends away from our everyday employed roles, finally reaching a stable point at which we all felt we could commit full time to its future. Now we can say proudly that our small business venture is gaining a great reputation throughout Cornwall for the service's we provide.

With many years of experience in the roofing and building industry, you are guaranteed to receive a friendly 5 star service from us. We specialise in slate & lead roof coverings but also pride ourselves in the attention to detail we give to all of our projects, no matter how big or small.

We are proud to be part of the ongoing refurbishment and development of the Carbis Bay Hotel properties and the new build housing development in the small Cornish village of Barripper.

2020 proved to be a hard year for everyone, but we must thank all of our customers for their business and support at a time when we really needed it. Going forward we hope our company can grow further and that our hard work and dedication to high quality roofing really starts to pay off!

We would love for you to take a look through our photo gallery at some of our roofing projects we've been proud to of been a part of. If you have any questions or if you would like a estimate for your next roofing project, please give us a call!
