## Our Story
Royal Roofing was formed in 2016, a team of highly skilled contractors with over 40 years combined experience in both domestic and commercial roofing applications. Today we can say proudly that our business is gaining a great reputation throughout Cornwall for the service's we provide.

We specialise in slate & lead roof coverings but also pride ourselves in the attention to detail we give to all of our projects, no matter how big or small.

We would love for you to take a look through our photo gallery at some of our roofing projects. If you have any questions or if you would like a estimate for your next roofing project, please give us a call.
