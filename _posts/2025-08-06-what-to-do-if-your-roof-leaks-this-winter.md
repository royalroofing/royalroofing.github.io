A leaking roof in the middle of winter is stressful‚Äîbut you're not alone, and fast action can minimize the damage. Here‚Äôs what to do if you discover a roof leak during cold or stormy weather.

## 1. Contain the Water

Place buckets, towels, or tarps to collect dripping water and protect furniture, floors, and electrical items. If the ceiling is bulging, poke a small hole to let water drain safely and avoid a collapse.

## 2. Identify the Source (If You Can)

If it's safe, try to determine where the water is coming from. It might be a missing tile, a broken flashing, or ice buildup in your gutters. This info helps roofers fix the issue faster.

## 3. Call a Professional Immediately

Don't wait‚Äîwater damage spreads fast. At Royal Roofing, we offer **24/7 emergency roof repair services across Cornwall**, including Truro, Newquay, and Bodmin.

## 4. Avoid DIY Repairs in Bad Weather

We know it's tempting, but climbing on your roof during winter storms is dangerous. Let professionals handle it with the right safety equipment.

## 5. Check for Insurance Coverage

If the damage is severe, contact your home insurance provider. They may cover emergency repairs, especially if caused by storm damage.
