As winter approaches, your roof becomes your homeâ€™s first line of defense against harsh weather. Cold temperatures, heavy rain, strong winds, and even hail can all take a tollâ€”especially if your roof isnâ€™t properly prepared.

A little maintenance now can prevent costly repairs later. Hereâ€™s how to get your roof winter-ready and protect your investment.

## 1. Inspect for Visible Damage

Start by visually inspecting your roof from the ground. Look for missing, cracked, or curling shingles. These small issues can lead to leaks when winter storms hit. If you spot any damageâ€”or if youâ€™re unsureâ€”schedule a professional roof inspection. Itâ€™s always better to catch problems early.

## 2. Clean Out Gutters and Downpipes

Clogged gutters are one of the leading causes of water damage during winter. When leaves and debris block proper drainage, water can back up and seep under your roof or freeze and cause ice dams. Make sure your gutters and downpipes are clean, secure, and flowing freely.

## 3. Check Flashings and Seals

Roof flashingsâ€”those metal strips around chimneys, vents, and skylightsâ€”are common weak points. Over time, they can become loose or corroded, leading to leaks. Ensure all flashings and seals are intact and watertight before the bad weather sets in.

## 4. Trim Overhanging Branches

Overhanging tree limbs can cause serious damage during a storm. Snow-laden branches can break and fall, damaging your roof or gutters. Trim back any trees near your home to reduce risk.

## 5. Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection

Even if everything looks fine, itâ€™s a good idea to have your roof inspected by a qualified roofer before winter. A professional can spot issues the untrained eye might missâ€”and give you peace of mind knowing your roof is ready to handle the season ahead.
