## Slate Roofs

When properly installed and maintained a slate roof can last for decades and some can even last for centuries. A naturally strong material that absorbs little to no water means slate roofs are less susceptible to leaking and frost damage than other, less durable roofing materials.

A slate roof can add value to your property, comes in many different sizes and colours and will last for over 75 years meaning it is environmentally safe to use.

Slate Roofs:

* Adds value to a property
* Various sizes and colours
* Enviromental safe to use
* Naturally strong mmaterials

### Image galleries

TODO - Here are a few of our recent work â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-3.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-4.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-5.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-6.png">
</div>

### Image carousels

TODO
Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-3.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-4.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-5.png">
	<img src="/images/slate/image-6.png">
</div>
