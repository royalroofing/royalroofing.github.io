## Lead Work

Lead is one of the most effectively recycled materials in the world and today more lead is produced through recycling than mining. 

While the installation may at first appear marginally more expensive, the fact is its an exceptionally sustainable building material, as well as having an extremely long life span, make it great value for money.


Many advantajes:

* Exceptionally sustainable building material
* Extremely long life span
* Great value for money

### Image galleries

TODO - Here are a few of our recent work â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-3.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-4.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-5.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-6.png">
</div>

### Image carousels

TODO
Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-3.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-4.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-5.png">
	<img src="/images/lead/image-6.png">
</div>
