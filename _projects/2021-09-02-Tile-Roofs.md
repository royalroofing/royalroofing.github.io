### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-3.png">
</div>

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-3.png">
</div>
