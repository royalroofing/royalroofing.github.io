There are many advantages to choosing roof tiles in place of alternative options. 

You can enjoy peace of mind that man made roof tiles are impervious to rot and insect infestation damage. 

They are considered to be environmentally friendly as they are usually made from earth minerals rather than chemicals and some old tiles can even be recycled for new roof projects.

Many advantajes:

* Environmentally friendly
* Earth minerals rather than chemicals
* Old tiles can even be recycled

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-3.png">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-3.png">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-1.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-2.png">
	<img src="/images/tileroofs/image-3.png">
</div>
